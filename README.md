Hi everyone: So we're from Prospect High School our team was the Prospect Proggers(Get it :D). So our intent for this hackathon project was to solve the problem of keeping kids engaged during class. As many of us know, spending 7 hours a day at school is a droning experience(although spending 10 hours at a hackathon is a feat of itself :D) but we wanted to improve the student-teacher dynamics in the classroom. Speaking from first-hand experience, we've seen many that have either gone astray during class, either by playing video games or watching youtube during class, prevents them from absorbing the material given. Subsequently, this innate lack of focus leads many to perform abysmally, and we tried to solve that. The teachers are well aware of who is not paying attention and who are but-- in order to improve focus during the classroom, we tried to make a live guided question session. 

Similar to Kahoot or other softwares like that, Our software was intended to have teachers push out questions which would then appear on the student side of things and then they would be able to answer the questions which would then be stored on a local server and the teacher could download a report of all the student's responses(either as a pdf or docx). 

So the main objective was to help with solving the problem of students' wandering attention, and although it wasn't perfect, we're still proud of the result
Future Improvements: We could make the website visually appealing, have it more interactive and vibrant so that it would attract more students, have an account feature, and have a proper domain. Also Pinging the server(and making it work) :D)

Major Problems: Pinging the server, Pinging back and forth, creating JSON files that don't get deleted when the program starts. 
How to Run: Open Project, open html files, for the server: go to node js server ./server.js
